Yes, combining CNNs or ViTs with clustering for few-shot learning in classification tasks is a promising approach, and there have been several papers exploring related ideas. Here are a few notable examples:

1. **"Learning CNN on ViT: A Hybrid Model to Explicitly Class-specific Boundaries for Domain Adaptation"**: This paper discusses a hybrid model that leverages both CNNs and ViTs to find class-specific decision boundaries. The approach involves using ViTs to capture global representations and CNNs to capture local representations, which can be beneficial for few-shot learning¹.

2. **"Self-Promoted Supervision for Few-Shot Transformer"**: This study investigates the few-shot learning capabilities of ViTs. It finds that replacing CNN feature extractors with ViTs can sometimes impair performance, but also explores methods to enhance ViT performance in few-shot learning scenarios².

3. **"A Comparative Study of Vision Transformer Encoders and Few-Shot Learning Algorithms"**: This paper evaluates various ViT models alongside few-shot learning algorithms like ProtoNet, MatchingNet, and Reptile. It provides insights into the effectiveness of ViTs in few-shot learning tasks³.

### Potential Variation for a New Paper

To create a variation of these approaches, you could propose a novel architecture that combines the strengths of ViTs and clustering specifically for few-shot learning. Here's a high-level idea:

1. **Feature Extraction with ViT**: Use a ViT to extract feature vectors from the few-shot samples. ViTs can capture global dependencies and provide robust feature representations.

2. **Clustering for Prototype Generation**: Apply a clustering algorithm to the feature vectors to generate prototypes for each class. This can help in identifying representative features for each class with limited samples.

3. **Few-Shot Classification**: Use the generated prototypes for few-shot classification. For a new sample, extract its feature vector using the ViT and assign it to the nearest prototype cluster.

4. **Adaptive Learning**: Implement an adaptive learning mechanism that updates the prototypes as new samples are introduced, improving the model's ability to generalize from few-shot examples.

Here's a simplified diagram of the proposed architecture:

```
Few-Shot Samples -> [ViT Layers] -> Feature Vectors -> [Clustering Algorithm] -> Prototypes
New Sample -> [ViT Layers] -> Feature Vector -> [Nearest Prototype] -> Predicted Class
```

This approach leverages the powerful feature extraction capabilities of ViTs and the clustering algorithm's ability to identify representative features, making it well-suited for few-shot learning tasks.
